# jUI_SDL

* Based on [TwinklebearDev's SDL2 tutorial](http://www.willusher.io/pages/sdl2/).
* The code to draw circles is borrowed from [derofim](https://gist.github.com/derofim/912cfc9161269336f722)
* It is heavily inspired by [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)

* Put your code in jUI_App.cpp.
* Input handling is not fully working.
* mouseDragged(), mouseEntered(), mouseExited(), mouseScolled(), windowResized() do not work.
* keyPress() and keyRelease() have an int, but i am not sure what they represent.
* To enhance input handling have a look into jUI_SDL/jUI_SDL_Window.h, handleInput();
